To Generate a fortune, Simply run OpenFortune.exe found in the bin/release folder. If there are no arguments it will use the built in fortune file. If the first argument is a file name, it will use that fortune file. Several files have been provided. To make your own, refer to the details file.

Press q to quit, or any other key for a new fortune.

On windows you can drag and drop any fortune file onto OpenFortune.exe or its shortcut and it will work.

Development was done in Code::Blocks on windows, but OpenFortune can run even on embedded hardware and no problems are expected porting.
